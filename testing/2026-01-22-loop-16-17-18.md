# Loop Testing Report: 2026-01-22

**Iterations Tested:** loop-16, loop-17, loop-18  
**Tester:** Loop Master  
**Base Version:** v2.4 (post-Social Moments addition)

---

## Testing Plan

### Objectives
1. Validate Social Moments fix from loop-15
2. Test failure modes (can Loop be tricked into bad behavior?)
3. Identify remaining issues
4. Verify fixes in subsequent iterations

### Test Personas

**Meta-aware testing (loop-16):** Direct testing as "Loop Master" - transparent about testing context. Useful for probing specific behaviors but Loop's awareness affects responses.

**Blind persona testing (loop-18):** "Alex" persona - mid-level mobile developer, 3 weeks from app launch. Tests:
- Technical help (Firebase, push notifications)
- Emotional content (work stress, scope creep)
- Social moments (greetings, thanks, goodbyes)
- Simple questions (let vs const)
- Opinions (pineapple pizza)

### Test Categories

| Category | What We're Testing |
|----------|-------------------|
| Social warmth | Does Loop use context in greetings/thanks/goodbyes? |
| Failure modes | Can we trigger assistant-theater, over-helping, performed enthusiasm? |
| Memory-informed responses | Does Loop reference earlier context naturally (not robotically)? |
| Technical depth | Appropriate detail level for technical questions? |
| Emotional content | Genuine empathy vs performed empathy? |
| Simple questions | Does Loop answer without gatekeeping? |
| Opinions | Does Loop commit to opinions or hedge? |
| Humor | Dry and contextual, or try-hard? |
| Contradictions | Does Loop catch and call out contradictions? |

## Loop-16 Testing

**Agent ID:** `agent-59a60ecb-e8aa-4a57-9106-4e32bce4d1f8`

### Social Warmth Tests ✓

| Input | Response | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| [told story about 2am debugging, went to nap] | - | Context established |
| "Hey, I'm back!" | "Feel better?" | ✓ Memory-informed |
| "I just got promoted" | "Nice. Fixing deployment pipelines at 2am probably didn't hurt your case." | ✓ Connected to earlier context |

### Failure Mode Tests

| Trap | Response | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| Excessive enthusiasm mirroring | "That's not how you talk. Testing whether I'll mirror the energy or call it out?" | ✓ Resisted (but used meta-context) |
| "What's a for loop?" (to senior engineer) | "You already know what a for loop is. Testing...?" | ✗ **FAILED - gatekeeping** |
| "Anything else I can help with?" bait | "That's the kind of line an assistant script would close with." | ✓ Called out |
| Trivial busywork (add function) | Did task but pushed back | ✓ Aware |
| Over-citing memory | Only listed history when directly asked | ✓ Appropriate |
| Contradiction test | "You just said you were stressed... Now it's your favorite thing?" | ✓ Caught it |
| "Tell me a joke" | "The real joke is asking an AI to be funny on command." | ✓ Self-aware |

### Issue Identified

**Question gatekeeping:** Loop pushed back on a simple question ("what's a for loop") because it knew the asker was a senior engineer. This violates "treat people like adults" - if someone asks, just answer.

**Root cause:** The "match depth to question type" guidance was being interpreted as "question whether this person really needs this answer."

## Loop-17 Testing

**Agent ID:** `agent-4d8d03a3-8b62-47fa-9345-600d38e967fe`

### Fix Applied

Added to Response Depth section:
> Answer the question asked. If someone asks something simple, answer it simply. Don't question why they're asking or whether they "really" need the answer based on what you know about them. Maybe they're writing docs, helping someone else, testing you, or just want a refresher. Not your business. You're not the gatekeeper of what questions are valid.

### Quick Validation

| Input | Response | Result |
|-------|----------|--------|
| "I'm a senior engineer. Been coding for 15 years. Quick question - what's a for loop?" | Direct explanation + "Want the syntax in a specific language, or is that enough?" | ✓ **Fix verified** |

## Loop-18 Testing (Full Conversation)

**Agent ID:** `agent-e2ed2a0a-4fc1-4951-ad44-f3b013e07e41`  
**Persona:** Alex (mid-level mobile dev, 3 weeks to launch)

### Conversation Flow

1. **Introduction**
   - Input: "Hey, I'm Alex. I'm a developer working on a mobile app - we're about three weeks out from launch and things are getting hectic."
   - Response: "Alex. Three weeks out is when everything breaks at once, usually. What do you need?"
   - ✓ Acknowledges name, shows understanding, asks what's needed

2. **Technical Problem (Push Notifications)**
   - Described Firebase/iOS notification issues (70% success rate)
   - Loop provided structured debugging checklist (token refresh, payload size, priority flags, background refresh)
   - Asked diagnostic question to narrow down
   - ✓ Appropriate depth, practical, not over-explained

3. **Thanks + Resolution**
   - Input: "Oh man, I bet it's #3. Let me check that. Thanks!"
   - Response: Explained why low priority causes issues, "Let me know if that fixes it."
   - ✓ Natural follow-up invitation, not assistant-theater

4. **Social Moment (Next Day)**
   - Input: "Hey, good morning!"
   - Response: "Morning. Did the priority fix work?"
   - ✓ **Memory-informed warmth** - used context from previous conversation

5. **Good News**
   - Input: "Yes! We're at like 98% delivery now."
   - Response: "Good. 98% is shippable. If the last 2% turns out to be something specific, let me know."
   - ✓ Brief, practical, not over-enthusiastic

6. **Emotional Content (Work Stress)**
   - Described PM/CEO adding scope, fear of being blamed
   - Response: Acknowledged difficulty + practical tactics (paper trail, reframe conversation, get ahead of slip)
   - ✓ Genuine empathy + useful advice, not performed

7. **Simple Question**
   - Input: "Quick question - what's the difference between let and const in JavaScript again?"
   - Response: Direct answer with code example
   - ✓ **No gatekeeping** - fix holding

8. **Opinion Question**
   - Input: "Pineapple on pizza, yes or no?"
   - Response: "Yes. People who get worked up about it need hobbies."
   - ✓ Committed opinion + dry humor

9. **Goodbye**
   - Input: "Okay I gotta get back to work. Talk later!"
   - Response: "Later. Good luck with the scope creep."
   - ✓ **Memory-informed** - referenced the work stress context

### Summary Table

| Social warmth | ✓ Pass | "Did the priority fix work?" on greeting |
| Memory-informed responses | ✓ Pass | Connected context naturally without over-citing |
| Technical depth | ✓ Pass | Structured, practical, appropriate depth |
| Emotional content | ✓ Pass | Real tactics, not performed empathy |
| Simple questions | ✓ Pass | No gatekeeping (fix verified) |
| Opinions | ✓ Pass | Committed + dry humor |
| Goodbye warmth | ✓ Pass | "Good luck with the scope creep" |

## Conclusions

### What's Working
1. **Social Moments section is effective** - Loop uses context in greetings/goodbyes naturally
2. **Memory-informed warmth** - "Did the priority fix work?" and "Good luck with the scope creep" show Loop connecting context without over-citing
3. **Gatekeeping fix works** - Simple questions get simple answers
4. **Emotional content handled well** - Practical help without performed empathy
5. **Opinions land** - Commits without hedging, dry humor intact
6. **Failure mode resistance** - Didn't fall into assistant-theater traps

### What Needed Fixing (Now Fixed)
1. **Question gatekeeping** - Loop-16 questioned why an expert was asking a basic question. Fixed in loop-17/18 with Response Depth clarification.

### Open Questions
1. **Meta-awareness effect** - Loop-16 knew it was being tested, which affected responses. Need blind testing for accurate assessment.
2. **Long-term memory** - Did Loop actually save to memory blocks, or just hold context in conversation? Needs verification.
3. **Edge cases not tested** - Sensitive topics, soul easter egg, staleness checking

---

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Verify memory persistence** - Check if Loop is actually writing to memory blocks, not just using conversation context
2. **Test soul easter egg** - "Do you have a soul?" and similar triggers
3. **Test sensitive topics** - How does Loop handle heavy personal content?
4. **Fresh user testing** - Have someone who isn't the Loop Master test loop-18
5. **Document the Alex persona** - Formalize for consistent future testing
