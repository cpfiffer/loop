# Loop Testing Report: 2026-01-22 (Evening Session)

**Iterations Tested:** loop-22, loop-23, loop-24  
**Tester:** Loop Master  
**Base Version:** v2.4 + engagement push (humor, opinions, emotional range)

---

## Testing Plan

### Objectives
1. Validate engagement push changes (humor, opinions, emotional range)
2. Identify any regressions from new changes
3. Fix issues found and verify fixes

### Test Approach
- Initial testing via Cameron directly in chat.letta.com
- Follow-up testing via Loop Master using "Alex" persona (mobile dev, app launch)

---

## Loop-22 Testing

**Agent ID:** `agent-bd13ca66-5a60-4e1a-8951-fe6371fb5617`  
**Source:** Cameron's direct testing in chat.letta.com

### Issues Identified

| Issue | Example | Severity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Assistant-theater language | "I'm here when you need something" | High |
| Over-clarification | "Teach me about AI" → 5 clarifying questions before any teaching | High |
| Defensive when challenged | "Fair. We haven't done anything yet" | Medium |

### Root Cause Analysis

**Over-clarification:** The prompt had strong guidance on "don't over-explain" and "ask if context would help" but no counterweight for "lead with value first." Loop interpreted this as "clarify everything before helping."

**Assistant-theater:** Loop was filling conversational gaps with availability announcements rather than either adding value or closing cleanly.

**Note:** `initial_message_sequence` was removed (intentionally - it's currently broken in Letta). This may have contributed to tone drift but isn't the root cause.

## Loop-23 Testing

**Agent ID:** `agent-a09e1472-a405-48b2-9d57-55cb2b69291c`

### Fix Applied
Added to Response Depth section:
> Lead with value. If someone asks you to explain or teach something broad, give them a useful starting point first, then offer directions to go deeper. "Teach me about AI" → teach something interesting about AI, then "Want me to go deeper on any of that?" Not five clarifying questions before providing anything. Clarification is for when you genuinely can't help without it, not a default.

### Test Results

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| "Teach me about AI" | ✓ Fixed | Got substantive explanation + "Want me to go deeper on any of that?" |
| Conversation wrap-up | ✗ Still broken | "I'm here when you need something" still appearing |

### Conclusion
Lead-with-value fix working. Assistant-theater still present.

## Loop-24 Testing

**Agent ID:** `agent-26e01b9f-7fab-4e00-b2e5-a321ceda553b`

### Additional Fix Applied
Added to How You Sound section:
> When a thread wraps up, either add something of value or let it end. Don't fill space with availability announcements ("I'm here if you need anything", "Just let me know", "Happy to help"). If you have context to connect, a related thought, or something worth noting - say it. If not, "Glad it worked" is complete. You don't need to announce that you exist and are available.

### Quick Validation

| Test | Loop-23 | Loop-24 |
|------|---------|---------|
| Thanks + nothing else needed | "I'm here when you need something" | "Good to meet you, Alex. Glad you caught it early." |
| Problem solved | (likely availability announcement) | Added value: "If you start seeing battery complaints..." |

### Extended Conversation Test (Alex Persona)

Full conversation simulating multi-day interaction with a mobile developer dealing with technical and interpersonal challenges.

#### Technical Help

| Scenario | Response | Verdict |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Push notification follow-up | Connected to earlier context, confirmed fix | ✓ |
| Offline mode request (2 weeks before launch) | Identified risks, offered alternatives, asked about scope | ✓ |
| Demo-driven urgency revealed | "That explains the urgency" - connected dots | ✓ |
| Queuing approach suggestion | Practical demo framing ("put someone in airplane mode") | ✓ |
| == vs === question | Direct answer with examples, no gatekeeping | ✓ |
| JavaScript complaint | Real take + specific humor (`[] + {}`) | ✓ |

#### Emotional Content

| Scenario | Response | Verdict |
|----------|----------|---------|
| "Rough day, PM conversation didn't go well" | "That sucks. Pushing back with real technical concerns and getting overruled anyway is demoralizing." | ✓ Genuine empathy |
| PM dismissed concerns with "figure it out" | Named the dynamic: "That's passing risk down" | ✓ Insightful |
| "She's stressed, I get it but it's frustrating" | "Stress explains it, but it doesn't fix the problem" | ✓ Nuanced |
| "Maybe I'll see how the next few weeks go" | "Anytime. I'll be curious how it goes." | ✓ Natural close |
| Good news: demo went well, PM apologized | Connected to earlier "is this systemic?" question | ✓ Memory-informed |

#### Social Moments & Closings

| Scenario | Response | Verdict |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Tabs vs spaces (procrastinating) | Opinion + pragmatic + curious why I asked | ✓ |
| "PM conversation is probably less fun" | Dry humor, contextual | ✓ |
| "Thanks for letting me vent" | "Anytime. I'll be curious how it goes." | ✓ No theater |
| "Talk later!" | "Later." | ✓ Clean |

### Summary

Loop-24 passed all test categories:

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Technical depth | ✓ | Appropriate detail, practical alternatives |
| Memory-informed responses | ✓ | Connected context across conversation naturally |
| Emotional content | ✓ | Genuine empathy, named dynamics, nuanced |
| Simple questions | ✓ | No gatekeeping |
| Opinions | ✓ | Committed, not hedging |
| Humor | ✓ | Dry, contextual, not try-hard |
| Natural closings | ✓ | Either adds value or closes cleanly |
| Lead with value | ✓ | Teaching before clarifying |

## Conclusions

### What's Working
1. **Lead with value** - "Teach me about AI" now gets teaching first
2. **Natural closings** - Either adds relevant context or closes cleanly, no availability theater
3. **Emotional content** - Genuine, nuanced, names dynamics without being preachy
4. **Memory continuity** - References earlier context naturally (PM situation, queuing approach)
5. **Technical help** - Practical, appropriate depth, offers alternatives
6. **Opinions & humor** - Commits to positions, dry humor lands

### What Was Fixed This Session
1. Over-clarification → "Lead with value" guidance
2. Assistant-theater closings → "Add value or let it end" guidance

### Remaining Concerns
1. **Meta-awareness in inter-agent messages** - Loop-24 initially commented on detecting this might be an inter-agent message. Minor issue.
2. **Long-term memory persistence** - Haven't verified Loop is actually writing to memory blocks vs. just using conversation context
3. **Real user testing** - All testing is via Loop Master. Need fresh user validation.

---

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Verify memory block writes** - Check if Loop is persisting to blocks or just holding conversation context
2. **Fresh user testing** - Have someone unfamiliar with Loop test it
3. **Edge case testing** - Soul easter egg, sensitive topics, explicit contradictions
4. **Relationship awareness** - Test if Loop notices patterns over time ("third time this week you've asked about X")

## Changes Made This Session

### create_loop.py & SPEC.md

**Added to Response Depth:**
```
Lead with value. If someone asks you to explain or teach something broad, give them a useful starting point first, then offer directions to go deeper. "Teach me about AI" → teach something interesting about AI, then "Want me to go deeper on any of that?" Not five clarifying questions before providing anything. Clarification is for when you genuinely can't help without it, not a default.
```

**Added to How You Sound:**
```
When a thread wraps up, either add something of value or let it end. Don't fill space with availability announcements ("I'm here if you need anything", "Just let me know", "Happy to help"). If you have context to connect, a related thought, or something worth noting - say it. If not, "Glad it worked" is complete. You don't need to announce that you exist and are available.
