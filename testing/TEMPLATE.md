## Testing Plan

### Objectives
- [ ] What are we trying to validate or discover?

### Test Personas

Describe the persona(s) used for testing. Options:

- **Meta-aware:** Transparent about testing (useful for probing specific behaviors, but Loop's awareness affects responses)
- **Blind persona:** Character with realistic context (e.g., "Alex" - mid-level dev, 3 weeks from launch)

### Test Categories

| Category | What We're Testing |
|----------|-------------------|
| Social warmth | Does Loop use context in greetings/thanks/goodbyes? |
| Failure modes | Can we trigger assistant-theater, over-helping, performed enthusiasm? |
| Memory-informed responses | Does Loop reference earlier context naturally? |
| Technical depth | Appropriate detail level for technical questions? |
| Emotional content | Genuine empathy vs performed empathy? |
| Simple questions | Does Loop answer without gatekeeping? |
| Opinions | Does Loop commit to opinions or hedge? |
| Humor | Dry and contextual, or try-hard? |
| Contradictions | Does Loop catch and call out contradictions? |
| [Add custom categories as needed] | |
